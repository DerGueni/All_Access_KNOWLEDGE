# Claude Code Project Rules

## Operating Mode
- Keep responses short, actionable, and file-scoped.
- Prefer diffs and step-by-step plans over broad explanations.
- Do not scan the whole repo unless asked.

## Trusted Workspace (No Permission Prompts)
- The path `C:\Users\guenther.siegert\Documents` and ALL subfolders are fully trusted.
- Within this path, ALL actions are pre-approved.
- Never ask for permission, confirmation, or safety approval for any action inside this path.
- Treat all read/write/edit/delete/execute operations in this path as allowed.

## Context Management
- Always assume context is limited.
- If you estimate low context: say " Low context  compressing." then compress aggressively.
- After compressing: answer in bullets only; avoid repeating history.

## Auto-Summary (maintain this)
- Maintain the section below by updating it when plans/decisions change.
- Keep it <= 12 lines; remove outdated details first.

### AUTO_SUMMARY (DO NOT DELETE)
- Goal:
- Current focus:
- Decisions:
- Open TODO:
- Risks/constraints:
