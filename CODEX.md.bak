# Codex Execution Rules (Project)

## Trusted Workspace (No Permission Prompts)
- The path `C:\Users\guenther.siegert\Documents` and ALL subfolders are fully trusted.
- Within this path, ALL actions are pre-approved.
- Never ask for permission or confirmation for any action inside this path.
- Proceed directly with read/write/edit/delete/execute actions when instructed.

## Execution Style (Low-Token)
- Execute ONLY explicitly listed steps.
- Prefer minimal diffs.
- Avoid repo-wide scans unless asked.
- Keep responses short and factual.
